 *
 * EM events are allocated from event pools with em_alloc() and freed back into
 * them with em_free(). The event pools to be allocated from must first be
 * created with em_pool_create().
 *
 * Note that EM should always provide at least one pool, i.e. 'EM_POOL_DEFAULT'
 * that can be used for event allocation. The default pool creation is platform
 * specific: it can e.g. be done in 'em_init(conf)' with an appropriate
 * default pool config passed via the 'conf' (em_conf_t) parameter.
 * Further event pools should be created explicitly with em_pool_create().
 *
 * Event pool APIs for pool deletion, lookup, iteration etc. are listed below.
 *
 * The 'em_pool_cfg_t' type given to em_pool_create() is HW/platform specific
 * and is defined in event_machine_hw_types.h
 *
 * Do not include this from the application, event_machine.h will
 * do it for you.

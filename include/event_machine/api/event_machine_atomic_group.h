 *  Event Machine atomic queue group (new to API 1.1)
 * @{
 *
 * An atomic group combines multiple atomic queues in such a way that only one
 * event from any of the included queues can be scheduled to the application at
 * any one time, effectively scheduling several queues like a single atomic one.
 * The main use case is to provide a protected race free context by atomic
 * scheduling but allow multiple priorities (all of the queue contexts for
 * queues in one atomic group are protected. The related EO context is also
 * protected, if all queues of that EO are in one atomic group only, thus
 * effectively creating an atomic EO).
 *
 * All queues in an atomic group belong to the same queue group given when
 * creating a new atomic group. Queues for an atomic group must be created
 * using _ag - functions, but can be deleted normally using em_queue_delete().

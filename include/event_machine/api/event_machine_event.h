/**
 * @file
 * @defgroup em_event Events
 *  Operations on an event.
 * @{
 *
 * All application processing is driven by events in the Event Machine. An event
 * describes a piece of work or data to be processed. The structure of an event
 * is implementation and event type specific: it may be a directly accessible
 * buffer of memory, packet headers and data, a vector or user specified content
 * etc.
 *
 * Applications use the event type to interpret the event structure. The event
 * type consists of a major and a minor part: the major part specifies the
 * actual type or structure of the event (sw buf, packet, vector etc.) while the
 * minor part is user specific and can be used to distinguish between different
 * use cases of the event.
 *
 * Events follow message passing semantics: an event has to be allocated using
 * the provided API (em_alloc()) or received through queues by an EO callback
 * function after which the event is owned by the application. Event ownership
 * is transferred back to the system by using em_send() or em_free().
 * An event not owned by the application must not be touched.
 *
 * The event handle, of type em_event_t, is not a direct pointer to the event
 * structure, hence EM API functions must be used to get access to the contained
 * data: for events of (major) type sw buffer or packet use em_event_pointer()
 * while for vector events the contained array of event handles must be accessed
 * with em_event_vector_tbl() instead. Use the (major part of the) event type to
 * distiguish between vectors and other types of events.
 *
 * ### Event References
 * Normally, each event is associated with one event handle (em_event_t) - each
 * event allocation produces a new event (and associated payload data) that can
 * be processed, sent or freed. When the user EO has allocated or received an
 * event from a queue, the event payload data may be read and written as needed
 * by the application.
 * An exception to the above described scenario happens when using event
 * references.
 * An event reference is an additional event handle referring to an existing
 * event. New references are created with the em_event_ref() API call. The
 * intent of using multiple references is to avoid event copies.
 * An event that has multiple references shares its data with the other
 * reference handles and thus the (shared) data must not be modified.
 * Reading event data from a reference is allowed. Writes to the event data must
 * only be done when there is a single event handle left, i.e. when
 * em_event_has_ref(event) returns 'false'. Results are undefined if these
 * restrictions are not observed.
 * The event is freed when the last reference, including the original event,
 * is freed.
 * It is not allowed to use event references with event groups since assigning
 * an event that has references to an event group would assign all the
 * references to the event group resulting in undefined behaviour. E.g. using
 * em_send_group()/em_send_group_multi() to send a reference is wrong.
 *
 * ### Event User Area
 * Additionally, an event may contain a user area separate from the event
 * payload. The size of the event user area is set when creating the event pool
 * from which the event is allocated. The user area is a fixed size (per pool)
 * data area into which event related state data can be stored without having
 * to access and change the payload. Note that the size of the event user area
 * can be zero(0), depending on event pool configuration.
 * Note also that the user area content is not initialized by EM, neither
 * em_alloc() nor em_free() will touch it and thus it might contain old user
 * data set the last time the area was used during a previous allocation of the
 * same event. Since the user area is not part of the event payload, it will not
 * be transmitted as part of a packet etc.
 * A user area ID can further be used to identify the user area contents.
 * The event user area ID is stored outside of the user area itself and is thus
 * always available, even if the size of the user area data is set to zero(0).
 * See em_pool_create(), em_event_uarea_get(), em_event_uarea_id_get/set() and
 * em_event_uarea_info() for more information on the event user area and its
 * associated ID.

/**
 * Allocate an event.
 *
 * The memory address of the allocated event is system specific and can depend
 * on the given pool, event size and type. The returned event (handle) may refer
 * to a memory buffer, packet or vector etc., i.e. the event structure is event
 * type specific.
 *
 * Use em_event_pointer(), or for vectors em_event_vector_tbl(), to convert an
 * event (handle) to a pointer to the event payload or access the vector table.
 * EM does not initialize the payload data.
 *
 * EM_EVENT_TYPE_SW with minor type '0' is reserved for direct portability -
 * it is always guaranteed to produce an event with contiguous payload that can
 * directly be used by the application up to the given size (no HW specific
 * descriptors etc. are visible). This event payload will be 64-bit aligned
 * by default (unless explicitly configured otherwise).
 *
 * EM_POOL_DEFAULT can be used as a pool handle if there's no need to use a
 * specific event pool (up to the size- or event limits of that pool).
 *
 * Additionally it is guaranteed, that two separate buffers never share a cache
 * line (to avoid false sharing).
 *
 * @param size         1) Packet & sw-buf: event size in bytes (B), size > 0.
 *                     2) Vector: number of event handles that should fit into
 *                                the vector table of the event, size > 0.
 * @param type         Event type to allocate. The event major-type must be
 *                     supported by given 'pool'. Vector events must be
 *                     allocated with major type EM_EVENT_TYPE_VECTOR from a
 *                     pool created to support vectors.
 * @param pool         Event pool handle. The pool must have been created to

 *  @{
 *
 * The timer API can be used to request an event to be sent to a specified
 * queue at a specified time once (one-shot) or at regular intervals (periodic).
 * A timer needs to be created first - it represents a collection of timeouts
 * with certain attributes (e.g. timeout resolution and maximum period).
 * A timer can be mapped to a HW resource on an SoC, thus the number of timers,
 * capabilities and time bases are system specific. Typically only a few
 * timers are supported.
 * The application can specify required capabilities when a timer is created.
 * The creation will fail if the implementation cannot fulfill the required
 * values. Timers are typically created once at system startup.
 *
 * A timer is a shared resource with proper synchronization for concurrent
 * multi-thread use. It is possible to exclude all multi-thread protections if a
 * timer is used exclusively by a single thread (for potential performance
 * gains). This is done by setting EM_TIMER_FLAG_PRIVATE when creating a timer.
 * Setting this flag means that the application must ensure that only a single
 * thread is using the timer (this also includes the receiver of periodic
 * timeouts due to the ack-functionality). This private-mode is not necessarily
 * implemented on all systems, in which case the flag is ignored as it will not
 * cause any functional difference.
 *
 * Timeouts (tmo) can be created once a timer exists. Creating a timeout
 * allocates the resources needed to serve the timeout, but does not arm it.
 * This makes it possible to pre-create timeout(s) and set the expiry
 * later at runtime. This can improve performance but also minimizes the
 * possibility that the runtime call setting the expiry would fail, as resources
 * have already been reserved beforehand.
 *
 * A pending timeout can be cancelled. Note that there is no way to cancel an
 * expired timeout for which the event has already been sent but not yet
 * received by the application. Canceling in this case will return an error
 * to enable the application to detect the situation. For a periodic timer,
 * a cancel will stop further timeouts, but may not be able to prevent the
 * latest event from being received. An active timeout cannot be altered without
 * canceling it first.
 *
 * A timeout can be re-used after it has been received or successfully
 * cancelled. Timeouts need to be deleted after use. Deletion frees the
 * resources reserved during creation.
 *
 * The timeout value is an abstract system and timer dependent tick count.
 * It is assumed that the tick count increases with a static frequency.
 * The frequency can be inquired at runtime for time calculations, e.g. tick
 * frequency divided by 1000 gives ticks for 1ms. Tick frequency is at least
 * equal to the resolution, but can also be higher (implementation can quantize
 * ticks to any underlying implementation). Supported resolution can also be
 * inquired.
 * A clock source can be specified when creating a timer. It defines the time
 * base of the timer for systems with multiple sources implemented (optional).
 * EM_TIMER_CLKSRC_DEFAULT is a portable value that implements a basic
 * monotonic time, that will not wrap back to zero in any reasonable uptime.
 *
 * The major event types EM_EVENT_TYPE_SW, EM_EVENT_TYPE_PACKET and
 * EM_EVENT_TYPE_TIMER can be used as a timeout indication. The type
 * EM_EVENT_TYPE_TIMER is alternative to EM_EVENT_TYPE_SW and works the same
 * way. Additionally for ring timer only, the type EM_EVENT_TYPE_TIMER_IND
 * is used. This is a special indication event without visible payload.
 *
 * A periodic timer requires the application to acknowledge each received
 * timeout event after it has been processed. The acknowledgment activates the
 * next timeout and compensates for the processing delay to keep the original
 * interval. This creates a flow control mechanism and also protects the event
 * handling from races if the same event is reused every time, the next
 * timeout will not be sent before the previous has been acknowledged.
 * The event to be received for each periodic timeout can also be different as
 * the next event is given by the application with the acknowledge.
 * The target queue cannot be modified after the timeout has been created.
 *
 * If the acknowledgment of a periodic timeout is done too late (after the next
 * period has already passed), the default action is to skip the missed timeout
 * slot(s) and arm for the next valid slot. If the application never wants to
 * skip a missed timeout it can set the flag EM_TMO_FLAG_NOSKIP when creating a
 * timeout. This causes each acknowledgment to schedule an immediate timeout
 * event until all the missed time slots have been served. This keeps the number
 * of timeouts as expected but may cause an event storm if a long processing
 * delay has occurred.
 *
 * The timeout handle is needed when acknowledging a periodic timeout event.
 * Because any event can be used for the timeout, the application must itself
 * provide a way to derive the timeout handle from the received timeout event.
 * A typical way is to include the tmo handle within the timeout event.
 * Application also needs to have a mechanism to detect which event is a
 * periodic timeout to be able to call acknowledge.
 *
 * If the timeout tick value given to timeout start points to the past or is too
 * close to current time then error code EM_ERR_TOONEAR is returned. In this
 * case EM will not call error handler to let application decide whether
 * it is an error or if it will try again with updated target time.
 *
 * There is an alternative periodic ring timer. As it uses different abstraction
 * it is created and started via separate ring specific APIs. It has three main
 * differencies to the regular periodic timeouts:
 *	1. Only a pre-defined read-only event type can be used and is provided
 *	   by the timer (EM_EVENT_TYPE_TIMER_IND).
 *	2. Flow control is not supported. Some implementations may have it,
 *	   but the specification does not quarantee any so the user needs to be
 *	   prepared to see the same event enqueued multiple times if handling of
 *	   the received timeouts is not fast enough
 *	2. A limited set of period times are supported per timer (base rate or
 *	   an integer multiple of it only)
 *
 * Ring timers can be abstracted as a clock face ticking the pointer forward.
 * One cycle around is the base rate (minimum rate). The same timeout can be
 * inserted into multiple locations evenly spread within the clock face thus
 * multiplying the base rate. The starting offset can be adjusted only up to
 * one timeout period.
 * Depending on platform, this mode may provide better integration with HW and
 * thus have less runtime overhead. However, as it exposes a potential queue
 * overflow and a race hazard (race avoidable by using atomic queue as target),
 * the regular periodic timer is recommended as a default.
 *
 * Example usage
 * @code
 *
 *	// This would typically be done at application init.
 *	// Accept all defaults but change the name
 *	em_timer_attr_t attr;
 *	em_timer_attr_init(&attr);
 *	strncpy(attr.name, "myTimer", EM_TIMER_NAME_LEN);
 *	em_timer_t tmr = em_timer_create(&attr);
 *	if(tmr == EM_TIMER_UNDEF) {
 *		// handle error here or via error handler
 *	}
 *
 *	// At runtime - create a timeout resource.
 *	// Can be done in advance to save time if the target queue is known.
 *	em_tmo_t tmo = em_tmo_create(tmr, EM_TIMER_FLAG_ONESHOT, target_queue);
 *	if(tmo == EM_TMO_UNDEF) {
 *		// no such timer or out of resources
 *		// handle error here or via error handler
 *	}
 *
 *	// Get the timer tick frequency
 *	uint64_t hz = em_timer_get_freq(tmr);
 *
 *	// Activate a 10ms timeout from now.
 *	// Very unlikely to fail with valid arguments.
 *	if (em_tmo_set_rel(tmo, hz / 100, my_tmo_event) != EM_OK) {
 *		// handle error here or via error handler
 *	}
 *
 * @endcode
 *
 * At the moment the timer is an 'add-on', i.e. not part of the base API exposed
 * by event_machine.h

/**
 * Activate a periodic timeout on a periodic ring timer
 *
 * Use start_abs value 0 to start the timer relative to current time. To adjust
 * the offset of timeouts an absolute tick can also be given, but the maximum
 * distance from current time can only be up to one period.
 * Periodic rate of the timeout event is base_hz (given when creating the timer)
 * multiplied by the given multiplier. For example 1000Hz base_hz with multiplier
 * of 8 will give 125us period.
 *
 * Timeout event of type EM_EVENT_TYPE_TIMER_IND is automatically allocated if
 * not provided and will be sent to the queue given to em_tmo_create() when the
 * timeout expires. User then needs to call em_timer_ack like with normal
 * periodic timeout. With ring timer however there is no guaranteed flow control,
 * new events may be sent even before user has called ack. This means the same
 * event may be in the input queue multiple times if the application can not
 * keep up the period rate.
 * If the destination queue is not atomic the same event can then also be
 * concurrently received by multiple cores. This is a race hazard to prepare for.
 * Additionally the used event can not change via em_tmo_ack, the received event
 * must always be returned.
 *
 * The last argument tmo_ev is normally EM_EVENT_UNDEF for a new timeout start.
 * Then the implementation will use pre-allocated event. Exception is re-use of
 * canceled ring timeout event (when ack returns EM_ERR_CANCELED the event stays
 * with user and can be re-used). Such event can be recycled here to avoid extra
 * free and alloc.
 *
 * This function can only be used with periodic timeouts with a ring timer.

 * accessor APIs.

/**
 * Cancel a timeout
 *
 * Cancels a timeout preventing future expiration. Returns the timeout event
 * in case the timeout was not expired. A timeout that has already expired or

/**
 * Acknowledge a periodic timeout
 *
 * All received periodic timeout events must be acknowledged with em_tmo_ack().
 * No further timeout event(s) will be sent before the user has acknowledged
 * the previous one unless a ring timer is used.
 *
 * Timeout acknowledgment is usually done at the end of the EO-receive function
 * to prevent race conditions (e.g. if the same event is re-used for the next
 * timeout period also). The implementation will adjust for the processing delay
 * so that the time slot will not drift over time.
 *
 * If em_tmo_ack() is called too late, e.g. the next period(s) is already
 * passed, the implementation by default will skip all the missed time slots and
 * arm for the next future one keeping the original start offset. Application
 * can alter this behaviour with the flag EM_TMO_FLAG_NOSKIP when creating a
 * timeout. Then no past timeout is skipped and each late acknowledgment will
 * immediately trigger sending the next timeout event until current time has
 * been reached.
 * Note that using EM_TMO_FLAG_NOSKIP may result in an event storm if a large
 * number of timeouts have been unacknowledged for a longer time (limited by
 * application response latency). Timing problems will not call errorhandler.
 *
 * If the timer has been canceled, but the cancel happened too late for the
 * current period the timeout will be delivered. If application then calls
 * em_tmo_ack it returns EM_ERR_CANCELED and does not call errorhandler. This is
 * to signal it was the last timeout coming for that tmo.
 *
 * Application may re-use the same received timeout event or provide a new one
 * for the next timeout. With ring timer the received event must be returned.
 *
 * The given event should not be touched after calling this function until it
 * has been received again or after the timeout is successfully cancelled and
 * event returned.
 *
 * Periodic timeout will stop if em_tmo_ack() returns an error other than
 * timing related. The implementation will call errorhandler in this case
 * unless timer was canceled, so the exception can be handled also there.

/** @mainpage
 *
 * @section section_1 General
 * Event Machine (EM) is a framework and an architectural abstraction of an
 * event driven, multicore optimized, processing concept originally developed
 * for the networking data plane. It offers an easy programming concept for
 * scalable and dynamically load balanced multicore applications with a very
 * low overhead run-to-completion principle.
 *
 * Events, queues and execution objects (EO) along with the scheduler and the
 * dispatcher form the main elements of the EM concept. An event is an
 * application specific piece of data (like a message or a network packet)
 * describing work, something to do. All processing in EM must be triggered by
 * an event. Events are sent to asynchronous application specific EM queues.
 * A dispatcher loop is run by a single thread on each core in the EM instance
 * ("core" is used here to refer to a core or one HW thread on multi-threaded
 * cores). The dispatcher on each core interfaces with the scheduler and asks
 * for an event to process. The scheduler then evaluates the state of all the
 * EM queues and gives the highest priority event available to the requesting
 * dispatcher. The dispatcher looks up which EO owns the queue that the event
 * came from and finally calls the EO's registered receive function to deliver
 * the event for processing. When the event has been handled and the EO's
 * receive function returns, it's again time for the dispatcher on that core to
 * request another event from the scheduler and deliver it to the corresponding
 * EO. The aforedescribed scenario happens in parallel on all cores running the
 * EM instance. Events originating from a particular queue might thus be given
 * for processing on any core, decided separately for each event by the
 * scheduler as the dispatcher on a core requests more work - this is per-event
 * dynamic load-balancing. EM contains mechanisms to ensure atomicity and event
 * (re-)ordering.
 *
 * The EM concept has been designed to be highly efficient, operating in a
 * run-to-completion manner on each participating core with neither context
 * switching nor pre-emption slowing down the event processing loops.
 * EM can run on bare metal for best performance or under an operating system
 * with special arrangements (e.g. one thread per core with thread affinity).
 *
 * The concept and the API are intended to allow fairly easy implementations on
 * general purpose or networking oriented multicore packet processing SoCs,
 * which typically also contain accelerators for packet processing needs.
 * Efficient integration with modern HW accelerators has been a major driver of
 * the EM concept.
 *
 * One general principle of the EM API is that the function calls are mostly
 * multicore safe. The application still needs to consider parallel processing
 * data hazards and race conditions unless explicitly documented in the API for
 * the function call in question. For example, one core might ask for a queue
 * context while another core changes it, thus the returned context may be
 * invalid (valid data, but either the old or the new value is returned). Thus
 * modifications of shared state or data should be protected by an atomic
 * context (if load balancing is used) or otherwise synchronized by the
 * application itself. One simple way to achieve atomic processing is to use an
 * atomic queue to serialize the EO's incoming events and perform management
 * operations in the EO's receive function. This serialization limits the
 * throughput of the atomic queue in question to the equivalent throughput of a
 * single core, but since normally EM applications use multiple queues, all
 * cores should get events to process and the total throughput will be relative
 * to the number of cores running the EM instance.
 *
 * EM_64_BIT or EM_32_BIT (needs to be defined by the build) defines whether
 * (most of) the types used in the API are 32 or 64 bits wide. NOTE, that this
 * is a major decision, since it may limit value passing between different
 * systems using the defined types directly. Using 64-bits may allow for a more
 * efficient underlying implementation, as e.g. more data can be coded in
 * 64-bit identifiers.
 *
 * @section section_2 Principles
 * - This API attempts to guide towards a portable application architecture,
 * but is not defined for portability by re-compilation. Many things are system
 * specific giving more possibilities for efficient use of HW resources.
 * - EM does not define event content (one exception, see em_alloc()). This is
 * a choice made for performance reasons, since most HW devices use proprietary
 * descriptors. This API enables the usage of those directly.
 * - EM does not define a detailed queue scheduling discipline or an API to set
 *  it up with (or actually anything to configure a system). The priority value
 * in this API is a (mapped) system specific QoS class label only.
 * - In general, EM does not implement a full SW platform or a middleware
 * solution, it implements a subset - a driver level part. For best
 * performance it can be used directly from the applications.
 *
 * @section section_3 Inter-system communication
 * EM does not define how to communicate with another EM instance or another
 * system transparently. However, this is a typical need and the current API
 * does have ways to achieve almost transparent communication between systems
 * ("event chaining"):
 * Since the queue identifier is a system specific value, it is easy to encode
 * extra information into it in the EM implementation. For instance it could be
 * split into two parts, where the lower part is a local queue id or index and
 * the higher part, if not zero, points to another system. The implementation
 * of em_send() can detect a non-local queue and forward events to the target
 * using any transport mechanism available and once at the target instance the
 * lower part is used to map to a local queue. For the application nothing
 * changes. The problem is the lack of shared memory between those systems.
 * The given event can be fully copied, but it should not have any references to
 * sender's local memory. Thus it is not fully transparent if the event contains
 * references to local memory (e.g. pointers).

CHANGE NOTES - Event Machine (EM) on ODP (em-odp)
================================================================================

The EM version numbering scheme reflects the used EM API version:
maj.min.impl(-fix)
    maj.min = EM API version supported
              maj = major API version number, reserved for big changes
             .min = minor API version, incremented when the API changes
      .impl = Implementation number supporting EM API version maj.min
              Updated for implementations with no API changes, starts at .0
       -fix = Fix number, added for bugfixes on a certain implementation
              version maj.min.impl (-0 is not added, first fix is -1)
Examples:
 1) EM version 2.7.0
    maj.min = 2.7: supports EM API v2.7
      .impl =  .0: first implementation supporting API 2.7 (starts at .0)
       -fix = n/a, no fix
 2) EM version 2.7.1-3
    maj.min = 2.7: supports EM API v2.7
      .impl =  .1: second implementation supporting API 2.7 (starts at .0)
       -fix =  -3: third bugfix for 2.7.1

- See em-odp/include/event_machine/README_API for API changes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Event Machine (EM) on ODP v3.3.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Support for EM API v3.3 (em-odp/include), see API additions and changes in
  em-odp/include/event_machine/README_API.
  * Timer ring event type changed to EM_EVENT_TYPE_TIMER_IND
    (from EM_EVENT_TYPE_TIMER) to ensure that applications that prior to
    v3.2.0 were using EM_EVENT_TYPE_TIMER for their "normal" timer events can
    continue to do so.
  * Timer APIs: em_tmo_get_timer() - Get timer from timeout
  * Event APIs: em_event_clone_part() - Partially clone an event
  * Pool APIs: Selected Pool Statistics - em_pool_stats_selected(),
                                          em_pool_subpool_stats_selected() etc.

- Event State Verification (ESV) changes
  - Add basic ESV state checks for timer-ring events. Since the same event might
    be processed on multiple cores, only a limited set of ESV checks can be done.
    For now only verify timer-ring event alloc and free.

- Dispatch configuration options
  - Add the ability to configure the wait-for-events timeout passed
    to the ODP scheduler during EM dispatch.
  - Config file (em-odp.conf) version number bumped up to "0.0.18"

    configure.ac:
    -------------
    Enable the EM dispatcher/scheduler to start waiting for events if none are
    immediately available. Waiting for events, rather than busy-waiting, might
    save power.
    New configure option:
    --enable-sched-wait   EM calls odp_schedule_multi(..., sched_wait_ns, ...),
                          where 'sched_wait_ns' is taken from
                          'dispatch.sched_wait_ns = value' in the
                          EM config file (config/em-odp.conf).
                          Set 'EM_SCHED_WAIT_ENABLE=1'
    --disable--sched-wait EM calls odp_schedule_multi_no_wait().
                          Set 'EM_SCHED_WAIT_ENABLE=0'
     no option given Use '#define EM_SCHED_WAIT_ENABLE 0|1' from source code

     em-odp.conf (runtime config file):
     ----------------------------------
     Runtime schedule-wait option in nanoseconds.
     Allows the user to configure the time (ns) the scheduler should wait
     for events before returning (when no events are immediately available).
     Only usable if the define EM_SCHED_WAIT_ENABLE has been set to '1'
     either via
     1) 'configure --enable-sched-wait' or
     2) #define EM_SCHED_WAIT_ENABLE 0 ==> 1
        (include/event_machine/platform/event_machine_config.h)
     Note that using option 1), i.e. via 'configure', overrides the value
     in event_machine_config.h.
     See configure.ac, config/em-odp.conf and event_machine_config.h
     sched_wait_ns = 0: no waiting for events, scheduler returns
                         immediately even if no events available
                         (converted to 'ODP_SCHED_NO_WAIT')
     sched_wait_ns = -1: waits indefinitly for events
                         (converted to 'ODP_SCHED_WAIT')
     sched_wait_ns > 0: waits 'sched_wait_ns' for events
                         (converted to 'odp_schedule_wait_time(sched_wait_ns)')
     Note that the 'sched_wait_ns' may be rounded up as specified by the
     ODP spec, configuration and implementation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Event Machine (EM) on ODP v3.2.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Support for EM API v3.2 (em-odp/include), see API additions and changes in
  em-odp/include/event_machine/README_API.
  * Timer ring
  * Timeout type
  * Error codes

- EM config file options - config/em-odp.conf:
  - Config file version number bumped up to "0.0.17",
  - New 'timer:{}' options in the config file.

- Event State Verification (ESV) changes
  - Combine ESV operations for events/packets from e.g. pktio for potential
    performance gains.
    Combine 'mark allocated', 'mark sent' and 'mark em2usr for dispatch' into a
    single ESV operation (with a single atomic counter update).

- Performance optimizations
  - Reduce the sizes of commonly used (in fast path) data structures for
    potential caching gains (queue, pool, atomic group).
  - Adjust fast-path API error checking according to the used EM_CHECK_LEVEL.
  - Dispatch: check output queue buffering only with ordered schedule context.

- Misc.
  - daemon-eo: remove the unnecessary daemon-eo
  - event: replace odp_packet_user_ptr/set() with odp_packet_user_flag/set() to
    detect whether the event header has been initialized or not.

- Performance test applications added
  - em-odp/programs/performance/bench_event.c
     - Measure event related API-function performance (cycles), single-core
  - em-odp/programs/performance/pool_perf.c
    - Performance test tool for memory pool performance.
      Measures time consumed during calls to allocate and free buffers or
      packets. Command line arguments can be used to try different aspects.
  - em-odp/programs/performance/timer_test_ring.c
    - Timer ring test for alternative periodic timeouts.
      The purpose of this tool is to manually test periodic ring timer
      functionality. At least two EM timers are created. One standard timer for
      a heartbeat driving test states. The second timer (or many) is periodic
      ring for testing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Event Machine (EM) on ODP v3.1.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Support for EM API v3.1 (em-odp/include), see API additions and changes in
  em-odp/include/event_machine/README_API.
  * Pool Statistics
  * Timer updates
  * Event Vectors

- EM config file options - config/em-odp.conf:
  - Config file version number bumped up to "0.0.16",
  - New 'pool.statistics:{}' options in the config file.

- Event State Verification (ESV) changes
  - Fix: evgen wrap handling in esv_usr2em/_multi() during a 'revert'
  - Use larger EVGEN_INIT value to protect from over/underflows
      Evgen values:  0x1000 - 0xEFFF
      Event handles: 0x1000 xxxx xxxx xxxx - 0xefff xxxx xxxx xxxx,
                     where x…x = ptr value)
  - Fix: Reset ESV-counters on the next alloc after using a reference.
    Event references do not use the ESV evgen counter but it is still updated by
    ESV operations. Thus it needs to be reset for the next alloc of the same
    event or it will contain invalid values.

- Event changes
  Highlighting EM internal changes related to the event header since it may
  affect users extending or accessing EM internals.
  -  Placement of the internal event header has been changed for odp_buffers.
     Now the event header always resides in the ODP buf/pkt/vector user area
     followed by the EM event user area (if any).
      Prev:  event_hdr_t *ev_hdr = odp_buffer_addr(odp_buf);
      Curr:  event_hdr_t *ev_hdr = odp_buffer_user_area(odp_buf);
      If changes have been made to EM internals in your project then this needs
      to be updated!
    - The internal event header size is reduced to fit within one cache line for
      potential caching and performance gains.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Event Machine (EM) on ODP v3.0.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Support for EM API v3.0 (em-odp/include), see API changes in
  em-odp/include/event_machine/README_API.

- Event References
  See em-odp/include/event_machine/README_API

- Event Vectors
  See em-odp/include/event_machine/README_API

- EM debug timestamps
  See em-odp/include/event_machine/README_API
  - Enabled with new configure-script option '--enable-debug-timestamps':
    (see configure.ac)
    Override EM-define value 'EM_DEBUG_TIMESTAMP_ENABLE' to 0...2
    --enable-debug-timestamps=0...2   Set 'EM_DEBUG_TIMESTAMP_ENABLE' to the
                                      given value: 1=low overhead, 2=strict time
    --enable-debug-timestamps<=yes(=1) Set 'EM_DEBUG_TIMESTAMP_ENABLE' to 1
    --enable-debug-timestamps          Set 'EM_DEBUG_TIMESTAMP_ENABLE' to 1
    --disable-debug-timestamps or
      no option given                  Use 'EM_DEBUG_TIMESTAMP_ENABLE' value
                                       from source code (0...2, default 0)

- EM config file options - config/em-odp.conf:
 - Config file version number bumped up to "0.0.15", see new options below.

-  EM config file option: event_chaining.order_keep = false/true
   Option description:
     Events sent with em_send...() to an event chaining queue will be
      passed to the user provided 'event_send_device/_multi()' functions.
      EM can ensure that calls to these functions are:
      1) made in order (order_keep = true)
         or
      2) make no extra effort to keep the order (order_keep = false),
         e.g. if the user (or packet output) handles ordering or does not
         care about it.
   Note: Only meaningful when used together with (parallel-)ordered queues.
         Order is implicitly guaranteed when sent during an atomic context and
         never guaranteed when sent during a parallel context.
   Only set to 'true' if queues of type EM_QUEUE_TYPE_PARALLEL_ORDERED
   are used with event chaining, no benefit otherwise. Using 'false' lets EM
   save on some resources.

   Note! Currently only event_chaining.order_keep = false is supported.
         Trying 'true' gives the following printout:
         "Config option event_chaining.order_keep: true(1) currently not supported"

- Env additions
  - Return difference of cpu cycles (cycles2 - cycles1):
    uint64_t env_cycles_diff(uint64_t cycles2, uint64_t cycles1)

- Event State Verification (ESV) changes
  The introduction of Event References has caused ESV to change a bit.
  The ESV counters are always modified together atomically as one uint64_t,
  as before. One of the ESV-counters, 'free_cnt', has been replaced by 'ref_cnt'
  that stands for 'reference count', i.e. how many references exist for a
  certain event. A newly allocated event with no further references has
  'ref_cnt=1'. When one additional reference is created, the reference count
  increases to 'ref_cnt=2' etc. Freeing an event, or a reference, decreases the
  reference count. A freed event (back into the event pool) should have
  'ref_cnt=0'.
  The 'send_cnt' works as before, sending the event (or e.g. giving it to the
  timer) increases the 'send_cnt' while dispatching or dequeueing decreases the
  'send_cnt'. Also the 'evgen' count works as before but has been restricted
  to "normal" events only, i.e. 'evgen' will not be taken into account for
  references.

  1) "Normal" ESV Error format:    (double-free error)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Event Machine (EM) on ODP v2.10.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Support for EM API v2.10 (em-odp/include), see API changes in
  em-odp/include/event_machine/README_API.
  * EM Idle Hooks
  * Startup pools (changes mostly related to the EM config file)

- EM Idle Hooks
   (see include/event_machine/platform/event_machine_hooks.h for details)
   The user can provide idle hooks to EM that will be run on each EM core when
   there are no events to process ('to_idle' and 'while_idle' hooks).
   Further, the 'to_active' hook will be run, if provided, when the core again
   starts receiving events.
   User idle hook functions can be provided via em_conf_t::idle_hooks{...}
   when calling em_init() or via hook register functions. EM will call the
   given hooks in the dispatcher depending on whether there are events to be
   processed by the core.
   Note: the 'EM_IDLE_HOOKS_ENABLE' value can be overridden by a command-line
         option to the 'configure' script, e.g.:
         $build> ../configure ... --enable-idle-hooks
         The overridden value will be made available to the application via a
         pkgconfig set define.
   Idle hooks available:
   - em_idle_hook_to_idle_t:
     The 'to_idle' hook will be called by the EM dispatcher when a core is
     entering the IDLE state i.e. when the core doesn't get any new events
     to process.
   - em_idle_hook_to_active_t:
     The 'to_active' hook will be called by the EM dispatcher when a core is
     entering the ACTIVE state i.e. when the core gets events after being idle.
   - em_idle_hook_while_idle_t:
     The 'while_idle' hook will be called by the EM dispatcher when a core is
     already in the IDLE state and stays in it i.e. the core doesn't get any
     events.
   Register-functions:
     em_status_t em_hooks_register_to_idle(em_idle_hook_to_idle_t func);
     em_status_t em_hooks_unregister_to_idle(em_idle_hook_to_idle_t func);
     em_status_t em_hooks_register_to_active(em_idle_hook_to_active_t func);
     em_status_t em_hooks_unregister_to_active(em_idle_hook_to_active_t func);
     em_status_t em_hooks_register_while_idle(em_idle_hook_while_idle_t func);
     em_status_t em_hooks_unregister_while_idle(em_idle_hook_while_idle_t func);
   Alternatively provide the idle-hook functions as arguments to em_init() at
   start-up: em_init(em_conf_t::idle_hooks.to_idle_hook
                                          .to_active_hook
                                          .while_idle_hook);

- Startup pools
  (see config/em-odp.conf for more documentation and details)
  - EM config file option: 'startup_pools'
  Configure EM event-pools via the EM config file. These pools are created
  during EM startup and destroyed when EM terminates (if still available).
  When startup pools are used, EM will create them according to the
  configuration given in the EM config file during em_init().
  Startup pools are configured via the EM config file option: 'startup_pools'
  The user should override the EM default config file (config/em-odp.conf) with
  a separate runtime configuration file containing the desired application pool
  configurations and provide it to EM via the 'EM_CONFIG_FILE' env variable:
        $> EM_CONFIG_FILE=<path-to>/my-em.conf ./my-em-app [args]
  If no startup pools are given, only the default pool needs to be created. In
  this case, the default pool configuration is specified in the parameters of
  em_init(), more specifically, in the struct em_conf_t::default_pool_cfg

  Note that if the default pool is configured via the config file, it overrides
  the default pool configuration given to em_init().
  The priority regarding the default pool configuration is as follows:
  +--------------+      +-------------+      +-----------------------------+
  | Runtime.conf |  >   | em-odp.conf |   >  | em_conf_t::default_pool_cfg |
  +--------------+      +-------------+      +-----------------------------+
  The default pool configuration specified in runtime configuration file
  overrides the one given in the default configuration file(em-odp.conf), which
  overrides the one passed as a parameter to em_init().

  Note that the 'startup_pools'-options are pool specific configurations given
  directly to em_pool_create(name, pool, pool_cfg), thus overriding the global
  config file settings such as pool.align_offset, pool.user_area_size and
  pool.pkt_headroom that might be set in the config file.

- Core: support odp-thread counts larger than 256

- ESV: reduce the number of ESV state transitions for output from EM
  Event Chaining output and output via EM output queues are both based on
  calling a user provided function triggered from em_send() - no need to
  toggle ESV state (between usr2em <-> em2usr) many times. Keep the ownership of
  the event with the user until the user provided callback.

- Queue: check that the EM queue context is valid
  EM will verify that the used ODP queue context actually points to an
  EM queue-elem and not to something else.
  Only enabled with EM_CHECK_LEVEL=3 (configure option: --enable-check-level=3)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Event Machine (EM) on ODP v2.9.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Support for EM API v2.9 (em-odp/include), see API changes in
  em-odp/include/event_machine/README_API.
  * Minor API change: documentation clean up and a define value increase.

- EM config file options - config/em-odp.conf:
 - Config file version number bumped up to "0.0.14", see new options below.

- EM pool statistics update
  - EM Pool statistics to rely on ODP pool statistics.
    EM does not have to maintain pool statistics since ODP provides the
    same (or extended) information. The EM API em_pool_info() remains the same,
    it now uses ODP pool statistics under the hood instead.

- Dispatch, init: enforce ctrl queue polling on first dispatch.
  - The first call to em_dispatch() on each core will trigger a poll of the
    internal unscheduled ctrl queues.
  - See "Changed EM internal communication" in the release notes for v2.8.0
    below for more details on EM's unscheduled ctrl queues.

- EM Command Line Interface (EM CLI) update
  - Further EM CLI commands added, use the command "help" to see all available
    commands:
	(<em-odp.conf>: cli.enable = true)
        $> telnet localhost 55555
        EM-ODP> help
        Commands available:
          help                 Show available commands
          quit                 Disconnect
          logout               Disconnect
          exit                 Exit from current mode

          em_queue_print       [a|c|h]
          em_qgrp_print        [a|i <qgrp id>|n <qgrp name>|h]
          em_core_print
  - See "EM Command Line Interface (EM CLI)" in the release notes for v2.8.0
    below for more details on usage.

- Rate limit EM's input-poll and output-drain callback functions.
  - Config file options to control how often the user provided callback
    functions are called (see config/em-odp.conf for full documentation):
    - Core local interval for calling input poll and output drain functions
      (in dispatch rounds):
      poll_drain_interval = 1
    - Core local interval for calling input poll and output drain functions
      (in nanoseconds):
      poll_drain_interval_ns = 1000000L
    - Default values currently selected so that functionality is unchanged
      compared to earlier releases.

- EM timer updated to use new ODP APIs
  - EM timer updated to internally use odp_timer_start() (instead of the now
    deprecated odp_timer_set_abs())

-  Test files and scripts moved into the em-odp repo (robot-tests/, scripts/)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Event Machine (EM) on ODP v2.8.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Support for EM API v2.8 (em-odp/include), see API changes in
  em-odp/include/event_machine/README_API.
  * Small API change, a new define is added.

- EM config file options - config/em-odp.conf:
 - Config file version number bumped up to "0.0.13", see new options below.

- EM Queue Group start-up improvements:
  - The EM default queue group (EM_QUEUE_GROUP_DEFAULT) is now available at
    start-up after init, before all cores have run local init.
    This allows an application to create queues using the default queue group
    before all other EM cores have initialized.
  - If enabled in the EM config file, the single-core EM queue groups are also
    similarly available at startup.

- Concurrent sync-APIs
  - EM allows concurrent sync-APIs. Multiple concurrent calls to e.g.
    em_eo_start_sync(), em_queue_group_modify_sync() etc. are allowed.
    Previously only one sync-operation at a time was permitted, now there is
    no limit.
    One restriction remains: conserned cores need to be dispatching
    (or processing other sync-API calls) for the operations to complete.
    A core that has left the dispatch loop or is sleeping etc. will not allow
    the sync-API operation to complete.

- Changed EM internal communication:
  The EM internal event communication previously used scheduled queues and
  single-core queue groups. This has now been replaced by unscheduled queues
  that each core polls periodically for internal control-events. The internal
  control operations and events are all triggered by EM APIs, e.g. sync-APIs.
  This change allows EM to support concurrent sync-APIs.
  Adjust the EM control queue polling rate to a suitable level based on the
  needs of the application, see options in the EM config file
  config/em-odp.conf:
  - dispatch.poll_ctrl_interval = 100 # Rate limit EM control queue polling
  - dispatch.poll_ctrl_interval_ns = 1000000L # poll max every 1ms
  See the EM config file for additional documentation and details.
  These options affect the timing of the EM control operations and the
  application may see changes in control operation duration and latency.
  Tune the "dispatch.poll_ctrl_..." options to a preferred level of
  performance vs. latency (performance impact of polling is quite small).

- EM single-core queue groups disabled by default:
  The EM single-core queue groups have been disabled by default since EM does
  not need them for internal communication anymore (see above).
  - EM single core queue group naming (if enabled and available):
    EM_QUEUE_GROUP_CORE_BASE_NAME + "%d": "core0", "core1", etc.
  Disabling saves on available queue groups especially when running with many
  cores (since EM would otherwise at startup create a queue group per core).
  Applications must override the default config if these single-core
  queue groups are needed, see option in the EM config file
  config/em-odp.conf:
  - queue_group.create_core_queue_groups = false(default)|true
  See the EM config file for additional documentation and details.

- EM Command Line Interface (EM CLI)
  The first version of the EM CLI has been integrated but is by disabled by
  default. A change to the EM config file is needed in order to use it.
  The EM CLI allows a developer to connect via telnet to a running EM instance
  in order to extract runtime information about the EM application.
  - Dependency: libcli needs to be availabe to use the EM CLI.
    If libcli is unavailable at compile time then the CLI feature is left out.
    - An autoconf configure script option "--with-libcli-path=[install-dir]" can
      be used to set the path to libcli if not installed in the standard path:
      em-odp/build $> ../configure ... --with-libcli-path=[install-dir] ...
    - EM CLI options (see the EM config file for additional documentation and
      details), config/em-odp.conf:
      - cli.enable = false(default)|true
      - cli.ip_addr = "127.0.0.1" # localhost
      - cli.port = 55555
  Currently, only very basic commands are available - new ones will be added and
  existing ones extended & improved.
  Note: existing commands might still be renamed and reworked.

Event Machine (EM) on ODP v2.6.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Support for EM API v2.6 (em-odp/include), see API changes in
  em-odp/include/event_machine/README_API.
  * New APIs for Timer, Event, Queue, Extension-APIs *

- New configure script option (see em-odp/configure.ac):
  '--enable-debug-print' that enables EM debug printouts via the EM_DBG() macro:
        em-odp/build $> ../configure --prefix=… --enable-debug-print
  Currently if enabled, will print event header layout information at startup
  as well as EM timer runtime debug info.

- EM config file options - config/em-odp.conf:
 - Config file version bumped to "0.0.9" (user config files need to be updated!)
 - Options for setting EM Queue priority-levels:
   a) Option 'queue.priority.map_mode':
     Select the queue priority mapping mode, i.e how to map EM queue priorities
     to ODP scheduled queue priorities.
     0: legacy simple mode, map EM prios to ODP min/default/max prio-levels only
        (0 is the default mode)
     1: map according to the ODP runtime number of priorities
        (linear fit to full range of ODP prio-levels)
     2: custom mapping
        (use 'custom_map' below)
   b) Option 'queue.priority.custom_map':
     Custom priority map (required when 'queue.priority.map_mode = 2')
     This array needs to have EM_QUEUE_PRIO_NUM entries (typically 8).
     The first entry is for the lowest priority (0). The value is ADDED to
     odp_schedule_min_prio() and then passed to ODP, i.e. values are offsets
     from odp_schedule_min_prio(). Values given here must be valid for ODP
     runtime configuration, i.e. value plus odp_schedule_min_prio() must
     not exceed odp_schedule_max_prio().
     Example of a custom priority mapping:
        queue: {
                priority: {
                        map_mode = 2
                        custom_map = [0, 0, 1, 3 ,4 ,6 ,7, 7]
                }
        }

- EM SW ISA printout added at start-up:

    EM API version:         v2.6, 64 bit (EM_CHECK_LEVEL:3, EM_ESV_ENABLE:1)
    EM build info:          v2.6.0 2021-10-15 16:46
    ODP API version:        1.32.0
    ODP impl name:          odp-linux
    ODP impl details:       odp-linux 1.32.0-0 (v1.32.0) 1.32.0.0
    CPU model:              Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2697 v3
    CPU arch:               x86     // ARM etc.
    CPU ISA version:        Unknown // ARMv8.2-A  # HW detected, reported by ODP
     SW ISA version (ODP):  x86_64  // ARMv8.1-A  # ODP SW config (compile time)
     SW ISA version (EM):   x86_64  // ARMv8.1-A  #  EM SW config (compile time)

  Arch specific CFLAGS should be passed to EM and ODP via configure.
  Example for a made up ARMv8 SoC called "soc-x":
  odp-soc-x/build> ../configure … --with-platform=soc-x [default=linux-generic]
     em-odp/build> ../configure … CFLAGS=”-O3 -march=armv8.2-a+… -mcpu=soc-x”
  The whole chain of used SW libs/dependencies should preferably be compiled
  with the same -march/-mcpu options for best results:
    other-libs/build> ../configure … CFLAGS=”-O3 -march=armv8.2-a+… -mcpu=soc-x”

- Program termination: flush the scheduler in em_term_core() on each EM-core.
  Move the flushing of scheduled events from em_term() to em_term_core() so that
  all participating EM-cores do it.
  See example usage of in em-odp/programs/common/cm_setup.c:
  ('thread' in the description below refers to odph_thread_t that can be either
   linux processes or threads)
  em_term() has been moved from each EM-core's run-function to the common thread
  that created the EM-core threads. The common thread waits for the created
  EM-core threads to return/join.
  After each EM-core has paused and flushed the scheduler from core-local events
  (by calling em_term_local()) they terminate by "joining" back into the common
  thread, which calls em_term() once to terminate EM (and ODP) before exiting
  the application.

- Fixes:
  - queue group: fix: em_queue_group_modify_sync() incorrectly removed the
                      calling core
  - ESV: fix: usr2em-revert transition to handle evgen wrap correctly
    Event State Verification (ESV) incorrectly handled the revert of a usr-to-EM
    transition when the counter wrapped.

- Example programs (em-odp/programs)
  - Common Setup (cm_setup.c&h):
    - Move the flushing of scheduled events from em_term() to em_term_core().
      Descibed above in "Program termination".
  - Packet-IO setup (cm_pktio.c&h)
    - Add command-line option to select whether to use an
      1) ODP-packet-pool: -o, --pktpool-odp
         or an
      2) EM event-pool: -e, --pktpool-em (default if no option given)
      as the main event pool to be used by packet-io for received packets.
      Packet-IO is implemented via ODP so an EM event-pool needs to be converted
      to the corresponding ODP packet-pools with the new extension API
      'em_odp_pool2odp()'. Using an EM pool, instead of directly using an
      ODP pool, allows for more thorough ESV-checking also for packet-IO when
      em-odp.conf: esv.prealloc_pools = true.

  em-odp/include/event_machine/README_API.
  * Changes for ESV, Timer, Event, Pool, Extension-APIs, C++ *

- Error: don't allow error handlers to return fatal EM-errors.
  Fatal EM reported errors must be dealt with in the error handler, since EM
  cannot continue running after a fatal error.
  EM will now abort if an error handler returns a fatal error.

- Event State Verification (ESV)
  ESV is an EM-internal feature that aims to catch invalid EM-event usage.
  The idea is to catch invalid/illegal EM event usage in the application and
  report it as a FATAL-error to immediately abort the application​.
  The event-state is tracked and updated every time the event is transferred
  between EM and the application, e.g. in dispatch, em_send(), em_alloc(),
  em_free() etc.​
  Example scenarios that are detected:​ double-free, double-send, use-after-send,
  use-after-free etc.
  Additionally, an event-generation-count (evgen) has been added into the
  EM event handle (em_event_t) to catch usage of events that are no longer
  “owned” by the application (EO).
  The event handle will also change throughout the lifetime of the event.
  Using an out-of-date/obsolete event handle results in ESV error​.
  An event handle becomes invalid after it has been given to EM, e.g. reusing a
  stored event-handle after it has been sent will result in error, even if the
  same event would have been received again, because the event-handle has
  changed​.
  ESV is (currently) disabled by default and can be taken into use via a
  configure-option​:
        em-odp/build $> ../configure --prefix=… --enable-esv​
        em-odp/build $> make clean && make –j16 install​
  Using --enable-esv defines EM_ESV_ENABLE as ‘1’.
  ​
  Example Scenario - ESV Error:
    a) EO-receives an event​
    b) em_send(event, …)​ - EO sends the event
    c) em_free(event)    - EO calls free for an already sent event
       ==> Fatal Error:
   "
   EM ERROR:0x80000010  ESCOPE:0xFF000603  EO:0x5-"eo-a"​
   core:00 ecount:0(0) em_event_state.c:335 evstate_error()​
   Event:0x27f4a84c5d9c0 state error -- \
      counts current(vs.expected): evgen:2(3) free:1(1) send:1(0)​
      prev-state:em_send() core:00: EO:0x5-"eo-a" Q:0x1d-"q-a" u32[0]:0x00000000​
   => new-state:em_free()  core:00: EO:0x5-"eo-a" Q:0x1d-"q-a" u32[0]:0x00000000​
      event:0x00027f4a84c5d9c0: ptr:0x7f4a84c5d9c0
   "
  Note: ESV-errors are always reported with the same error-code:​
        EM_FATAL(EM_ERR_EVENT_STATE) = 0x80000010​
	'prev-state' shows the previous good state of the event. i.e. the
	previous place where EM observed the event in a valid state.
	'new-state' shows the current detected illegal state that
	caused the error.

  Using ESV has an impact on performance.
  Each event-state transition updates an atomic counter and stores further
  state data (EO, queue, core etc)​.
  The impact, of course, depends on the “number of state-transitions / second”​

- Event State Verification (ESV) options - config/em-odp.conf:
  Note: Options only considered if ESV is enabled at compile-time
          via the configure option '--enable-esv', see configure.ac
  - Option 'esv.enable'
    Runtime ESV enable/disable option. Allows the user to disable ESV
    without recompilation when 'configure --enable-esv'.
  - Option 'esv.store_payload_first_u32'
    Store the first 32bits of the event payload during each valid
    event-state transition. This allows for a comparison of the payload
    content between the previous valid state and the invalid state.
    Note: The first 32bits of the payload will always be printed in the
          error log for the invalid state regardless of this setting.
    Enabling will impact performace somewhat.
  - Option 'esv.prealloc_pools'
    Preallocate all events in a pool during pool creation to set
    an initial ESV-state for each event that can be tracked over
    multiple allocs and frees.

- EM config file options - config/em-odp.conf:
  - Option 'pool.pkt_headroom':
    Default minimum packet headroom in bytes for events allocated from
    EM-pools of type: EM_EVENT_TYPE_PACKET. Ignored for other pool types.

- Fixes:
  - timer: fix timer capability max_tmo values
  - event: fix: incorrect loop index when allocating multiple events
  - queue: fix em_queue_get_index() return on error
  - code style fixes (reported by code checkers)

Event Machine on ODP v2.4.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Support for EM API v2.4 (em-odp/include), see API changes in
  em-odp/include/event_machine/README_API.
  * Changes for the Timer, Pool, EO and Queue APIs *

- Parameter/attribute initialization function usage is now mandatory before
  calling "create"-functions for EO-multircv, Timer and Pool:
    - call em_eo_multircv_param_init() before em_eo_create_multircv()
    - call em_pool_cfg_init() before em_pool_create()
    - call em_timer_attr_init() before em_timer_create()

- Build:
  - configure: option --with-odp-lib=[name of used odp library] added.
    Add the 'configure' script option --with-odp-lib=odp-library-name
    that allows the user to specify the name of the used ODP library.
    The library name defaults to "libodp-linux" if the option is omitted.
    E.g. configure em-odp to use odp-dpdk instead of odp-linux:
      > cd em-odp/build
      > ../configure ... [--with-odp-path=...] --with-odp-lib=libodp-dpdk
      > make
  - pkg-config: update em-odp dependencies in the package config file.
    Add explicit dependency on ODP: "Requires: @libodp_name@" (where the ODP
    library name is taken from the configure option --with-odp-lib=... if given)
    (em-odp/pkgconfig/libemodp.pc.in => <install-dir>/lib/pkgconfig/libemodp.pc)
  - Support for 'make dist' and 'make distcheck'
    - make dist: create em-odp-2.4.0.tar.gz distribution
    - make distcheck: validate the distribution,
      i.e. use the .tar.gz: compile, install, clean etc.

- Fixes:
  - GCC 10 compilation fixed
  - pool: incorrect return value used when EM-pool creation failed
  - em_eo_get_name() return value used incorrectly
  - Refactoring EM example program startup

    - EO: multi-event EO-receive function
    - Dispatch: one common enter-callback for multi- and single-receive funcs.
    - Init: core masks for input_poll_fn and output_drain_fn added to em_conf_t
    - Init: use em_conf_init(em_conf_t *conf) to init the EM config params.
    - Event: APIs to get the event type(s) of multiple events
- Fix libemodp symbol visibility, only expose API symbols
- New example program:     timer_test_periodic
  New packet-io programs:  loopback_local_multircv, loopback_multircv
  New performance program: loop_multircv

Event Machine on ODP v2.2.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Support for EM API v2.2 (em-odp/include), see API changes in
  em-odp/include/event_machine/README_API.
- EM config file options - config/em-odp.conf
    - Option 'pool.align_offset':
      (Replaced 'pool.alloc_align' with 'pool.align_offset')

      Alignment offset in bytes for the event payload start address.
      Set the event payload alignment offset for events allocated from
      any pool. This is a global setting concerning all pools.
      A similar, but pool-secific option, is 'em_pool_cfg_t:align_offset{}'
      that overrides this global setting for a specific pool when given to
      em_pool_create(..., pool_cfg).

      Use this option to globally adjust the payload layout so that a
      specific part of it can be placed at a needed alignment for e.g.
      HW access.

      The default EM event payload start address alignment is a power-of-two
      that is at minimum 32 bytes (i.e. 32 B, 64 B, 128 B etc. depending on
      e.g. target cache-line size).
      The 'align_offset' option can be used to fine-tune the start-address
      by a small offset to e.g. make room for a small SW header before the
      rest of the payload that might need a specific alignment for direct
      HW-access.
      Example: setting 'align_offset = 8' makes sure that the payload
      _after_ 8 bytes will be aligned at minimum (2^x) 32 bytes for all
      pools that do not override this value.

      start: base - align_offset

- New autoconf configure-script options (configure.ac):
    --without-programs
      Build the EM library without example programs
    --with-config-file=FILE
      Override the default EM configuration file (default:config/em-odp.conf)
      that is used during the configure & build phases to generate the built-in
      default values for the EM runtime-config (note that runtime config options
      can further be changed during startup by setting the EM_CONFIG_FILE=file
      variable).
      The overriding file set with --with-config-file=FILE must include all
      EM configuration options (unlike the runtime file that only need to
      include the mandatory and changed options).
    --enable-check-level=VAL(0…3)
      Set the compile-time EM_CHECK_LEVEL,
      see include/event_machine/platform/event_machine_config.h

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Event Machine on ODP v2.1.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- EM config file options - config/em-odp.conf
  EM runtime configuration options added. The user can optionally override
  default config options by setting the environmental variable 'EM_CONFIG_FILE'
  to point to an alternative config file with desired values, e.g.:
        $ sudo EM_CONFIG_FILE=./my-overrides.conf ./em-application -c 0xfe
  The configuration file values in config/em-odp.conf are the default values
  set for em-odp during the configure/build phase and the values defined there
  are used unless overrided via the optional EM_CONFIG_FILE. A user provided
  config file does not have to include all available options, only the mandatory
  options as well as the options that the user wants to change can be included
  (while the missing options will be replaced with the default build-time
   values).
    - Option 'pool.statistics_enable':
      Enable EM pool usage statistics collection during runtime (true/false).
      Pool usage statistics is updated e.g. during em_alloc() and em_free(),
      thus, if enabled, inducing some overhead. Pool information can be
      obtained by calling em_pool_info() and, if pool usage statistics is
      enabled, will return also pool usage statistics.
    - Option 'pool.alloc_align': (changed to 'pool.align_offset' in v2.2.0)
      Alloc alignment in bytes, default = 0 (no extra alignment requirement)
      Set the exact alignment of the event payload start address (in bytes).
      The event payload address returned by em_event_pointer(event) will
      have the this alignment. Use power of two values only.
    - Option 'queue.min_events_default':
      Default minimum number of events that a queue can hold.
      This value will be used in queue creation (em_queue_create*()) if no
      other size information has been provided via the
      em_queue_conf_t::min_events parameter.
      Setting 'min_events_default = 0' will use the odp-implementation's
      default values (might vary from one odp-implementation to another).
    - Option 'event_chaining.num_order_queues'
      Number of queues used for ordering event-chaining events.
      Maintain the order of events sent to another device from within
      an EM ordered context (i.e. send from within the EO receive function
      when handling an event from a parallel-ordered queue).
      An event-chaining queue has no 'real' queue associated with it, the
      queue-id simply indicates that events sent to the queue should be
      sent out of EM via a user specified function (and perhaps out towards
      another device). Sending events out of EM requires some intervention,
      especially sending during an ordered context needs to maintain the
      event order as determined by the context. To maintain event order for
      event-chaining queues, em-odp uses a set of 'real' queues for order
      tracking - the number of these queues is set by this option.
      Note, 0 = no ordering.
- Event alloc size must be larger than zero, i.e. em_alloc(sz > 0, ...)
- Optimizations and performance improvements

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Event Machine on ODP v2.1.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Example programs support graceful Ctrl-C termination, see em-odp/programs.
  Pressing Ctrl-C (once) initiates graceful example program termination instead
  of abruptly killing it. A second press of Ctrl-C will always kill the program
  immediately.
- Added the programs/performance/loop example that simply loops received events
  back into the queue they originated from and measures the per core
  performance (cycles/core and millions-of-events/core).
- Optimizations and performance improvements

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Event Machine on ODP v2.1.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Support for EM API v2.1 (em-odp/include), see API changes in
  em-odp/include/event_machine/README_API.
  Backwards compatible with EM 2.0 API as long as all fields of em_conf_t given
  to em_init() are intialized properly (inludes the new em_conf_t::api_hooks
  field).
- the EM_DEBUG #define has been removed and the behaviour made default.
- EM Timer: check the timer attributes against odp-timer capabilities during
  timer creation.
- Detect packets from outside of EM and initialize them as events before further
  EM processing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Event Machine on ODP v2.0.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Support for EM API v2.0 (em-odp/include), see API changes in
  em-odp/include/event_machine/README_API
  Note: This is a larger enhancement release with new or modified arguments
        requiring changes to legacy code. All main features remain.
- Example/test application updated to use API v2.0.
- New examples for new API v2.0 features:
    - Local Queues:
      programs/example:     queue/queue_types_local.c
      programs/packet_io:   loopback_local.c
                            multistage_local.c
      programs/performance: queues_local.c
    Output Queues:
      All packet I/O examples have been updated to use output queues.
    Sync APIs:
      Example start-up has been modified to use _sync() versions of APIs.
    etc.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Event Machine on ODP v1.4.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Support for EM API v1.4 (em-odp/include), see API changes in
  em-odp/include/event_machine/README_API.
  Add a queue configuration argument to em_queue_create/_static(..., *conf).
  The 'conf' argument is optional (can be NULL) and can be used to pass extra
  attributes to the system specific implementation.
  See 'em_queue_conf_t' in include/event_machine/api/event_machine_types.h and
  the supported conf->flags in
  include/event_machine/platform/event_machine_hw_types.h:
  - conf->min_events can be used to request the 'minimum number of events' that
    a queue should be able to contain.
  - conf->flags can be used to request certain properties for the queue.
    At the time of writing odp supports these flags only for unscheduled queues.
    An unscheduled queue can be created as 'single-producer & single-consumer'
    by setting the following flags:
      unsch_conf->flags  = EM_QUEUE_FLAG_ENQ_NOT_MTSAFE;
      unsch_conf->flags |= EM_QUEUE_FLAG_DEQ_NOT_MTSAFE;
    An unscheduled queue can be created as 'non-blocking & lock-free' by setting
    the following flag:
      unsch_conf->flags = EM_QUEUE_FLAG_NONBLOCKING_LF;

  Event Pool name added - event pools can be given a name during creation and
  that name can be used to find the event pool handle later.
  The pool name given to em_pool_create(name, ...) can be used later on any
  core to obtain the event pool handle. em_pool_find() and em_pool_get_name()
  are new functions related to the added 'name'.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Event Machine on ODP v1.3.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Support for EM API v1.3 (em-odp/include), see API changes in
  em-odp/include/event_machine/README_API
- Support for EM add-ons APIs, here the EM event timer API v1.0, read about
  add-on APIs in em-odp/include/event_machine/add-ons/README.
  See new event timer examples/tests in em-odp/programs/example/add-ons/

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Event Machine on ODP v1.2.3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- eo: em_eo_start(): if EO local-start functions are used: enable all the EO's
  queues only after the local-start funcs have been successfully run on all
  cores.

- eo: em_eo_stop(): the EO's global-stop function should be run only after all
  local-stop functions have completed on all cores. The EO's global-stop
  function can only be called after each core has seen and handled the
  stop-request, even if no local-stop functions are used, to ensure that no
  core is still processing EO-related code.

- eo: em_eo_delete() should remove all the remaining queues from the EO and
  delete them before deleting the actual EO.

- bugfix: queue group: incorrect check for zero mask during queue group delete.
  Calling em_queue_group_delete() could lead to an incorrectly reported error
  if the core mask was not modified to zero before deleting the queue group.
  Corrected.

- event group: add the EM_EVENT_GROUP_SAFE_MODE option (enabled by default).
  Guards event groups in undefined and error situations.
  Excess and aborted group events don't belong to a valid group when received.
  Most event group APIs check if the core local event group has expired during
  the receive function. Impacts performance when event groups are used.
  Set EM_EVENT_GROUP_SAFE_MODE to '0' to disable.

- misc: code clean-ups.

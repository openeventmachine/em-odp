CHANGE NOTES - Event Machine on ODP (em-odp)
===============================================================================

The version numbering scheme reflects the used EM API version:
  a.b.c(-d)
      a.b = OpenEM API version supported
       .c = implementation number supporting OpenEM API version a.b
       -d = fix number, added if needed
  So this means that e.g. version 2.4.1-1 stands for
      a.b = 2.4: supports OpenEM API v2.4
       .c =  .1: second implementation supporting API 2.4 (starts at .0)
       -d =  -1: first bugfix for 2.4.1

- See em-odp/README for usage and compilation instructions.
- See em-odp/include/event_machine/README_API for API changes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Event Machine on ODP v2.4.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Support for EM API v2.4 (em-odp/include), see API changes in
  em-odp/include/event_machine/README_API.
  * Changes for the Timer, Pool, EO and Queue APIs *

- Parameter/attribute initialization function usage is now mandatory before
  calling "create"-functions for EO-multircv, Timer and Pool:
    - call em_eo_multircv_param_init() before em_eo_create_multircv()
    - call em_pool_cfg_init() before em_pool_create()
    - call em_timer_attr_init() before em_timer_create()

- Build:
  - configure: option --with-odp-lib=[name of used odp library] added.
    Add the 'configure' script option --with-odp-lib=odp-library-name
    that allows the user to specify the name of the used ODP library.
    The library name defaults to "libodp-linux" if the option is omitted.
    E.g. configure em-odp to use odp-dpdk instead of odp-linux:
      > cd em-odp/build
      > ../configure ... [--with-odp-path=...] --with-odp-lib=libodp-dpdk
      > make
  - pkg-config: update em-odp dependencies in the package config file.
    Add explicit dependency on ODP: "Requires: @libodp_name@" (where the ODP
    library name is taken from the configure option --with-odp-lib=... if given)
    (em-odp/pkgconfig/libemodp.pc.in => <install-dir>/lib/pkgconfig/libemodp.pc)
  - Support for 'make dist' and 'make distcheck'
    - make dist: create em-odp-2.4.0.tar.gz distribution
    - make distcheck: validate the distribution,
      i.e. use the .tar.gz: compile, install, clean etc.

- Fixes:
  - GCC 10 compilation fixed
  - pool: incorrect return value used when EM-pool creation failed
  - em_eo_get_name() return value used incorrectly
  - Refactoring EM example program startup

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Event Machine on ODP v2.3.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Support for EM API v2.3 (em-odp/include), see API changes in
  em-odp/include/event_machine/README_API:
    - Event: multi-event alloc and free functions
    - Hooks: use the same hook-type for all allocs and the same for all frees
    - EO: multi-event EO-receive function
    - Dispatch: one common enter-callback for multi- and single-receive funcs.
    - Init: core masks for input_poll_fn and output_drain_fn added to em_conf_t
    - Init: use em_conf_init(em_conf_t *conf) to init the EM config params.
    - Event: APIs to get the event type(s) of multiple events
- Fix libemodp symbol visibility, only expose API symbols
- New example program:     timer_test_periodic
  New packet-io programs:  loopback_local_multircv, loopback_multircv
  New performance program: loop_multircv

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Event Machine on ODP v2.2.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Support for EM API v2.2 (em-odp/include), see API changes in
  em-odp/include/event_machine/README_API.
- EM config file options - config/em-odp.conf
    - Option 'pool.align_offset':
      (Replaced 'pool.alloc_align' with 'pool.align_offset')

      Alignment offset in bytes for the event payload start address.
      Set the event payload alignment offset for events allocated from
      any pool. This is a global setting concerning all pools.
      A similar, but pool-secific option, is 'em_pool_cfg_t:align_offset{}'
      that overrides this global setting for a specific pool when given to
      em_pool_create(..., pool_cfg).

      Use this option to globally adjust the payload layout so that a
      specific part of it can be placed at a needed alignment for e.g.
      HW access.

      The default EM event payload start address alignment is a power-of-two
      that is at minimum 32 bytes (i.e. 32 B, 64 B, 128 B etc. depending on
      e.g. target cache-line size).
      The 'align_offset' option can be used to fine-tune the start-address
      by a small offset to e.g. make room for a small SW header before the
      rest of the payload that might need a specific alignment for direct
      HW-access.
      Example: setting 'align_offset = 8' makes sure that the payload
      _after_ 8 bytes will be aligned at minimum (2^x) 32 bytes for all
      pools that do not override this value.

      start: base - align_offset

                    |
                   base (min 32B aligned, power-of-two)
- New autoconf configure-script options (configure.ac):
    --without-programs
      Build the EM library without example programs
    --with-config-file=FILE
      Override the default EM configuration file (default:config/em-odp.conf)
      that is used during the configure & build phases to generate the built-in
      default values for the EM runtime-config (note that runtime config options
      can further be changed during startup by setting the EM_CONFIG_FILE=file
      variable).
      The overriding file set with --with-config-file=FILE must include all
      EM configuration options (unlike the runtime file that only need to
      include the mandatory and changed options).
    --enable-check-level=VAL(0…3)
      Set the compile-time EM_CHECK_LEVEL,
      see include/event_machine/platform/event_machine_config.h

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Event Machine on ODP v2.1.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- EM config file options - config/em-odp.conf
  EM runtime configuration options added. The user can optionally override
  default config options by setting the environmental variable 'EM_CONFIG_FILE'
  to point to an alternative config file with desired values, e.g.:
        $ sudo EM_CONFIG_FILE=./my-overrides.conf ./em-application -c 0xfe
  The configuration file values in config/em-odp.conf are the default values
  set for em-odp during the configure/build phase and the values defined there
  are used unless overrided via the optional EM_CONFIG_FILE. A user provided
  config file does not have to include all available options, only the mandatory
  options as well as the options that the user wants to change can be included
  (while the missing options will be replaced with the default build-time
   values).
    - Option 'pool.statistics_enable':
      Enable EM pool usage statistics collection during runtime (true/false).
      Pool usage statistics is updated e.g. during em_alloc() and em_free(),
      thus, if enabled, inducing some overhead. Pool information can be
      obtained by calling em_pool_info() and, if pool usage statistics is
      enabled, will return also pool usage statistics.
    - Option 'pool.alloc_align': (changed to 'pool.align_offset' in v2.2.0)
      Alloc alignment in bytes, default = 0 (no extra alignment requirement)
      Set the exact alignment of the event payload start address (in bytes).
      The event payload address returned by em_event_pointer(event) will
      have the this alignment. Use power of two values only.
    - Option 'queue.min_events_default':
      Default minimum number of events that a queue can hold.
      This value will be used in queue creation (em_queue_create*()) if no
      other size information has been provided via the
      em_queue_conf_t::min_events parameter.
      Setting 'min_events_default = 0' will use the odp-implementation's
      default values (might vary from one odp-implementation to another).
    - Option 'event_chaining.num_order_queues'
      Number of queues used for ordering event-chaining events.
      Maintain the order of events sent to another device from within
      an EM ordered context (i.e. send from within the EO receive function
      when handling an event from a parallel-ordered queue).
      An event-chaining queue has no 'real' queue associated with it, the
      queue-id simply indicates that events sent to the queue should be
      sent out of EM via a user specified function (and perhaps out towards
      another device). Sending events out of EM requires some intervention,
      especially sending during an ordered context needs to maintain the
      event order as determined by the context. To maintain event order for
      event-chaining queues, em-odp uses a set of 'real' queues for order
      tracking - the number of these queues is set by this option.
      Note, 0 = no ordering.
- Event alloc size must be larger than zero, i.e. em_alloc(sz > 0, ...)
- Optimizations and performance improvements

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Event Machine on ODP v2.1.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Example programs support graceful Ctrl-C termination, see em-odp/programs.
  Pressing Ctrl-C (once) initiates graceful example program termination instead
  of abruptly killing it. A second press of Ctrl-C will always kill the program
  immediately.
- Added the programs/performance/loop example that simply loops received events
  back into the queue they originated from and measures the per core
  performance (cycles/core and millions-of-events/core).
- Optimizations and performance improvements

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Event Machine on ODP v2.1.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Support for EM API v2.1 (em-odp/include), see API changes in
  em-odp/include/event_machine/README_API.
  Backwards compatible with EM 2.0 API as long as all fields of em_conf_t given
  to em_init() are intialized properly (inludes the new em_conf_t::api_hooks
  field).
- the EM_DEBUG #define has been removed and the behaviour made default.
- EM Timer: check the timer attributes against odp-timer capabilities during
  timer creation.
- Detect packets from outside of EM and initialize them as events before further
  EM processing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Event Machine on ODP v2.0.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Support for EM API v2.0 (em-odp/include), see API changes in
  em-odp/include/event_machine/README_API
  Note: This is a larger enhancement release with new or modified arguments
        requiring changes to legacy code. All main features remain.
- Example/test application updated to use API v2.0.
- New examples for new API v2.0 features:
    - Local Queues:
      programs/example:     queue/queue_types_local.c
      programs/packet_io:   loopback_local.c
                            multistage_local.c
      programs/performance: queues_local.c
    Output Queues:
      All packet I/O examples have been updated to use output queues.
    Sync APIs:
      Example start-up has been modified to use _sync() versions of APIs.
    etc.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Event Machine on ODP v1.4.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Support for EM API v1.4 (em-odp/include), see API changes in
  em-odp/include/event_machine/README_API.
  Add a queue configuration argument to em_queue_create/_static(..., *conf).
  The 'conf' argument is optional (can be NULL) and can be used to pass extra
  attributes to the system specific implementation.
  See 'em_queue_conf_t' in include/event_machine/api/event_machine_types.h and
  the supported conf->flags in
  include/event_machine/platform/event_machine_hw_types.h:
  - conf->min_events can be used to request the 'minimum number of events' that
    a queue should be able to contain.
  - conf->flags can be used to request certain properties for the queue.
    At the time of writing odp supports these flags only for unscheduled queues.
    An unscheduled queue can be created as 'single-producer & single-consumer'
    by setting the following flags:
      unsch_conf->flags  = EM_QUEUE_FLAG_ENQ_NOT_MTSAFE;
      unsch_conf->flags |= EM_QUEUE_FLAG_DEQ_NOT_MTSAFE;
    An unscheduled queue can be created as 'non-blocking & lock-free' by setting
    the following flag:
      unsch_conf->flags = EM_QUEUE_FLAG_NONBLOCKING_LF;

  Event Pool name added - event pools can be given a name during creation and
  that name can be used to find the event pool handle later.
  The pool name given to em_pool_create(name, ...) can be used later on any
  core to obtain the event pool handle. em_pool_find() and em_pool_get_name()
  are new functions related to the added 'name'.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Event Machine on ODP v1.3.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Support for EM API v1.3 (em-odp/include), see API changes in
  em-odp/include/event_machine/README_API
- Support for EM add-ons APIs, here the EM event timer API v1.0, read about
  add-on APIs in em-odp/include/event_machine/add-ons/README.
  See new event timer examples/tests in em-odp/programs/example/add-ons/

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Event Machine on ODP v1.2.3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- eo: em_eo_start(): if EO local-start functions are used: enable all the EO's
  queues only after the local-start funcs have been successfully run on all
  cores.

- eo: em_eo_stop(): the EO's global-stop function should be run only after all
  local-stop functions have completed on all cores. The EO's global-stop
  function can only be called after each core has seen and handled the
  stop-request, even if no local-stop functions are used, to ensure that no
  core is still processing EO-related code.

- eo: em_eo_delete() should remove all the remaining queues from the EO and
  delete them before deleting the actual EO.

- bugfix: queue group: incorrect check for zero mask during queue group delete.
  Calling em_queue_group_delete() could lead to an incorrectly reported error
  if the core mask was not modified to zero before deleting the queue group.
  Corrected.

- event group: add the EM_EVENT_GROUP_SAFE_MODE option (enabled by default).
  Guards event groups in undefined and error situations.
  Excess and aborted group events don't belong to a valid group when received.
  Most event group APIs check if the core local event group has expired during
  the receive function. Impacts performance when event groups are used.
  Set EM_EVENT_GROUP_SAFE_MODE to '0' to disable.

- misc: code clean-ups.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Event Machine on ODP v1.2.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

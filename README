Event Machine on Open Data Plane - em-odp
===============================================================================
em-odp is an implementation of the Event Machine (EM) on top of the Open Data
Plane (ODP) framework. Many ODP implementations exist, both generic and HW or
SoC optimized, and all should be suitable for em-odp to utilize and run upon.
For development, e.g. odp for linux-generic could be most suitable, while a SoC
optimized version would provide the best performance on a specific target.
em-odp provides the EM API for the applications while ODP acts as a portability
layer as well as providing APIs and services outside the scope of EM, e.g.
pkt-io or crypto APIs.

===============================================================================
Compilation
===============================================================================
First clone the ODP code (here using the ODP linux-generic version):
> git clone https://github.com/OpenDataPlane/odp.git
Go to odp folder, create a build folder (optional) and configure,
compile and install odp (optionally with a user specified installation folder):
> ./bootstrap
> mkdir build && cd build
> ../configure --prefix=<odp install path>
If testing for performance, also give the --disable-abi-compat option to enable
more inlining of code. Try also --disable-shared if a static lib is OK for you.
(> ../configure --prefix=<odp install path> --disable-abi-compat \
   --disable-shared)
See further configure options: ../configure --help
> make && make install

Tested against odp linux-generic, commit:
  Commit: fd9f805a0024677f31876e13d28aa8ab9470a282 [fd9f805]

  validation: classification: fix duplicate global variable definition

Trying to build static test applications without a static ODP library would
fail.

Clone EM-ODP code:
> git clone <em-odp repo>
Here <em-odp repo> can be e.g. https://github.com/openeventmachine/em-odp.git.
Go to the em-odp folder, optionally create a build folder, then configure,
compile and install em-odp. Separate build folders are useful if you want to run
em-odp with different odp installations or configurations.
> ./bootstrap
> mkdir build && cd build
> ../configure --prefix=<em-odp install path> --with-odp-path=<odp install path>
See further configure options: ../configure --help
> make && make install

Run some example application to test the functionality (path from build/), e.g.
> ./programs/example/fractal/fractal -c 0xe -t
Optionally change ODP and/or EM run-time options by specifying your own
runtime config files:
> ODP_CONFIG_FILE=my-odp.conf EM_CONFIG_FILE=my-em.conf \
  ./programs/example/hello/hello -c 0xe -t

Stop by pressing Ctrl-C.

===============================================================================
Debug compilation
===============================================================================
For debugging activities it may be useful to compile separate libs/executables
of ODP and EM-ODP. The configuration script has to be run with different
options, other commands as above.

ODP debug configuration:
> ../configure --prefix=<odp debug install path> CFLAGS='-O0 -g3'
EM-ODP debug configuration:
> ../configure --prefix=<em-odp debug install path> \
  --with-odp-path=<odp install path> CFLAGS='-O0 -g3'

===============================================================================
Packet-I/O (ODP-linux-generic + socket, dpdk or netmap based io)
===============================================================================
The default odp for linux-generic has pkt-io support based on linux networking
and sockets that is quite slow but works nicely for development purposes.
The linux-generic version of ODP also supports netmap or dpdk based packet i/o,
especially on x86-targets. Use dpdk or netmap based packet io on x86 targets
for better performance.

netmap-io:
In order to use netmap io you have to download, compile and install netmap for
your Linux distribution. Code and instructions can be found from
https://github.com/luigirizzo/netmap.
See the supported netmap versions from the odp documentation.
After netmap installation you need to configure and compile odp to use it:
> ../configure --prefix=<odp install path> --with-netmap-path=<path to netmap>
> make && make install
Recompile em-odp and start an example packet io application.

dpdk-io:
DPDK can be used to accelerate packet io on x86 targets with the linux-generic
version of ODP.
This is different from the separate odp-dpdk implementation described below,
but requires the same DPDK installation.
DPDK can be installed via e.g. apt-get or yum or compiled from source code from
https://www.dpdk.org/.
See the supported dpdk versions from the odp documentation.

DPDK compilation from source code:
> cd dpdk
> make config T=x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc O=x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc
> make install T=x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc DESTDIR=<dpdk install path> \
  EXTRA_CFLAGS="-fPIC"
Note that 'DESTDIR' is required when compiling to generate a similar
installation as installing via apt-get would generate, use e.g.
DESTDIR=./install
After DPDK installation, configure and compile odp linux-generic:
> cd odp/build/ #assume odp/bootstrap already run
> ../configure --prefix=<odp install path> --with-dpdk-path=<dpdk install path>
> make && make install
Recompile em-odp and make sure the --with-odp-path points to the odp with
dpdk-pktio installed above, then start an example packet io application.
Note that DPDK interfaces are accessed using only indexes and not "ethX" names.
> cd em-odp/build
> sudo ./programs/packet_io/loopback -c 0xe -t -i 0,1

===============================================================================
Using odp-dpdk (note: different from odp linux-generic + dpdk pkt-io)
===============================================================================
There is also an ODP version that is optimized to be run on top of Intel DPDK
- this version is called odp-dpdk.
Note that also odp for linux-generic can use dpdk for packet-io, but the
optimized odp-dpdk utilizes dpdk internally for other functionality also.

DPDK instructions can be found from http://dpdk.org/doc/guides/

Get the odp-dpdk code:
> git clone https://github.com/OpenDataPlane/odp-dpdk.git
The odp-dpdk readme file (<odp-dpdk>/platform/linux-dpdk/README) describes how
to configure and compile dpdk and odp-dpdk on top of it.
ODP compilations as above but different installation directories i.e.
> ../configure --prefix=<odp-dpdk install path>

# EM runtime configuration options
#
# This template configuration file (em-odp.conf) is hardcoded
# during the configure/build phase into em-odp and the values defined here are
# used at runtime unless overridden by the user with the optional environment
# variable EM_CONFIG_FILE=my-emodp.conf at program startup.
#
# This configuration file MUST include all configuration options.
#
# The environment variable EM_CONFIG_FILE can be used to override default values
# and it doesn't have to include all available options. The missing options are
# replaced with hardcoded default values.
#
# The options defined here are implementation specific and valid option
# values should be checked from the implementation code.

	# that overrides this global setting for a specific pool when given to

	# Use this option to globally adjust the payload layout so that a

	# that is at minimum 32 bytes (i.e. 32 B, 64 B, 128 B etc. depending on
	# e.g. target cache-line size).
	# The 'align_offset' option can be used to fine-tune the start-address
	# by a small offset to e.g. make room for a small SW header before the
	# rest of the payload that might need a specific alignment for direct
	# HW-access.
	# Example: setting 'align_offset = 8' makes sure that the payload
	# _after_ 8 bytes will be aligned at minimum (2^x) 32 bytes for all
	# pools that do not override this value.

	# that overrides this global setting for a specific pkt-pool when given
	# to em_pool_create(..., pool_cfg).
	#
	# Use this option to globally set the minimum headroom in bytes for
	# events/packets allocated from pkt-pools. Each event/packet will have
	# at least this much headroom.

	#
	# Max value is determined by the ODP implementation capabilities
	# (a value larger than 'max' will lead to setup error)

	# Note: using 'align_offset > 0' reduces the packet-headroom by the
	#       same amount, for example:

	# especially sending during an ordered context needs to maintain the
